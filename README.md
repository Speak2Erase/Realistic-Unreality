This modpack is shipped WITHOUT the Earth world, as it's roughly 15 GB in size. In order to play this modpack in Singleplayer, you will have to generate one yourself.

**Here's a quick guide to create a world for this modpack.**
1. Visit [this website](https://earth.motfe.net/), and click on Downloads.
2. Scroll ALL the way to the bottom.
3. Download `earth_1-1000_1-12.world` from the WorldPainter files.
4. Download WorldPainter from [here](https://www.worldpainter.net/).
5. Open the `earth_1-1000_1-12.world` file in WorldPainter, and export it with the following settings: 
- Set the name to **DIM24**.
- Under Custom Layers, disable all of the the End Portals.
6. Before creating a new world, open the saves folder in your MultiMC Minecraft instance.
7. Create a new folder, name it whatever you want, and place the DIM24 world inside.
8. Launch the modpack, and create a new world with the same name as the folder you created earlier.
9. Your world is ready to play on.

**If you want to play the pack without using earth, there are two ways. You can either:**
1)Edit the config file
2)Use commands (Not reccomended)

1) Navigate to your config folder in your multimc instance. Search for overworldmirror.cfg. Open it. Scroll down until you find the line mentioning a void world. Change true to false. This makes the world not void.

2) Use /dimensiontp and click on the overworld. Press launch. You are now in the overworld.

*Note that these methods may change the experience. I would recommend using method 1.*

**Frequently asked questions**
Why is the world void? - It's to stop people from going outside the earth map and finding stuff they shouldn't.

How do I make an overworld portal? - Questbook.

How much ram do I need? - Depends. On a server, you'll need 6gb max. Playing singleplayer, anywhere from 8gb - 10gb depending on wether you use earth or not. This is a very ram heavy pack.

How long is the loading time? - 10ish minutes, give or take. If you have it installed on an SSD, have high R/W speed RAM, and have a *very* beefy CPU, you'll get quicker times, ~5-7minutes.

How difficult is it? - Not RLCraft levels of difficult, but if you don't dig a hole at night, you'll be in for a bad time.

How many mods? - 300 and counting.
